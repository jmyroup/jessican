# uci_projects
This will be a repository of the HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, PHP/MySQL, and JavaScript projects and code snippets that I've completed during my Web Design & Development certificate program.

For a large scale project example, please visit http://www.infinitusdesigns.com.  This site was originally hosted on WordPress, but I migrated it to Bigcommerce, and, using both the WYSIWYG editor and by hand-coding in Adobe Dreamweaver, completely restructured, redesigned, and relaunched the site.  I also did all of the product photography and photo/graphic editing.
